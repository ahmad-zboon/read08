# Functions
: Is a blocks of codes that performs a task or calculates a value.

**Why use Functions**?

- You can ***reuse*** code
: Define the code once, and use it many times.

- You can use the same code many times with different arguments, to produce different results.

### ***Notes***
Function **Parameters** are listed inside the **parentheses ()** in the function definition.

Function **Arguments** are the values received by the function when it is **invoked (Call)**.

Inside the function, the arguments (the parameters) behave as local variables.

Function **Return** 
: When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing.
